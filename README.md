## Getting Started ##

Copy the `Signal.ts` and `SignalBinding.ts` files into your TypeScript project.

If you wish you can place them inside a module, but by default they are set to global classes.

Reference the `Signal.ts` file in your code and then use them as normal. Look at the tests provided in the `tests` folder for plenty examples of use, or read the JS-Signals documentation.
